API THROTTLING
--------------

# Merged the api-throttling gem with minimal interval methods from the rack-throttle gem.
# And vendorized in the plugins directory.
# Added an dependency to Airbrake by adding a Airbrake notifier if rate limit is exceeded.

REDIS
------

# In production on Heroku we use Redis (add-on RedisToGo) as cache for the api-throttling
# Add a redis.yml config file with the url to redistogo
# See https://redistogo.com/documentation/heroku
